            <title><![CDATA[The Eye Within the Eye]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Eye Within the Eye</h1>,<h2>A good photo</h2>,<p>There is something about a quality photograph that really speaks to us.</p>,<p>I know a few good photographers. And I know that if we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with identical cameras and snapped pictures of the same kid we get different results. People would look at my photos and say, “Look. cute kid.”</p>,<p>But from a photographer with a gift, they’d say something like, “I just can't stop looking at this kid. Look her eyes! You can just sense…” Or, “The eyes practically reach out of the picture…”</p>,<p>I’ve heard people say that the secret to good photography is lighting or composition or some other technical aspect. I can tell you first hand that’s not so. I’ve taken thousands of pictures in my lifetime and few actually exude life.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3d5311a5-e169-4ae8-a651-8edf5f78e2fc.jpg">,<p>No doubt, those things are important. But there is far more to it.</p>,<p>People like <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">Kathleen Roche</a> have that innate ability to give a photograph life. I envy them.</p>,<p>I use her work here and hope to do so more on the future.</p>,<p>But among the hobbies, habits and passions one may pursue, one that can bring real satisfaction as well as tangible results would have to be photography.</p>,<p>Tom Jordan, a photographer from Pennsylvania, says the he goes out and just walks. It could be on the beach, or in Philadelphia or in his favorite park (location secret) and he says, “I don’t know what I’m going to get, or where I’m going to get it, but I know that day I’m going to really nail a picture.” </p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxljtEKgjAYhV9l-AD7ly3NMAmELqNXWPPXjdJ_bEPp7ZtCF9HlgfN959wNRWKtx87GE6sVMx77c2ZidOEEsCwL719WPz3XNIJb2wFkUUl52BWXmxCwF1JWVZGXxxyyxmHnKdiRMJQ1qIZdN5rNVv3akzwZXW8HE1d31rTfuHF_V7RHFe2MqTvSFDj5AZIbp4ABHm_IuUj7Wm_0B8D6RvE" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is a Man?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>What is a Man?</h1>,<p>There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn’t <strong>quite</strong> uniquely American, but it’s close.</p>,<p>In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT…There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cda046e5-8625-475e-a4c9-6a82b5ba424e.jpg">,<p>Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case we celebrate the strong, American male role model.</p>,<p>The man we celebrate teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they’ll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.</p>,<p>He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he’s developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.</p>,<p>The REAL American man says “thank you” to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.</p>,<p>He isn’t arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aec9e9a1-246f-48e3-b12a-a23b001c8879.jpg">,<p>If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.</p>,<p>This is the man our site is dedicated to.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dcb3c7c-752a-4a15-bf93-b729bc7b8a2f.jpg">,<p>Photo credit: <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo</a></p>,<p><a href="http://itsamans.world/but-not-every-guy-is-married-with-kids" title="">But Not every guy is married with kids!</a></p>,<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>,<p>The pictures in this article gave me a thought. This website will use advertising to keep the lights on. And we will make the ads content appropriate. We won’t put an ad for an iPad in a post about chain saws.</p>,<p>Anyway, the thought. Tools kits for kids. One of the most important things I think I missed as a kid was familiarity with proper tools and their uses, and mechanical experience. I learned much of it in the Navy and I am a self-taught furniture maker. But I’d have been much further ahead of the game as a young man if someone had mentored me in <em>any</em> of the trades.</p>,<p>So here are some suggestion for bringing kids into the trades in a fun way. By “playing” with your son or daughter, going through the motions of using play tools, you not only engage them in a learning activity, you create a bond around that activity.</p>,<h2>For the Toddler:</h2>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFv2zAMhe_7FYEPuqVWHDdxu6pDhwHtBgwdEGxXgZZoR4sluRRTL_v1c5QW2DuJj9SnB-rOdQQeF4lPA6picpb3t6tKjn8-7tH1e76t6nNRLDxQ70IeUIV8ry9D2UiG4jC40KsixGKRuW0ki3Rpk1FFWU5pGeAKPPyNYQk2nRKjvzLRlzO6R07ly6cd0qsz-AspuRhUJeVWNlUlngN-26mVeB6RgM-tR-QH-8R-EN-BDsg_BjCofu5EikeaT2AEYae40-wGAVbzaUQ1UrRHw3oOexBMYA5zau2s8sC_Iy0rKXzGjRl3CTuD-vOTMzzbHgOrz3L1UO--rBopILmQ_jfO9K9WYd3AWm5N3dZd09xsO7ttrjebFuR1C3Z9I9I-TvptUR0MCfNNHUcMSbugA056csHGSTEdUYw070abOERS6yzBjod3S8rNxkjR9m91l1Xcf1jMuisv_33_D-41rgQ" height="244"></iframe>,<p>I chose this kit because it had a good variety of tools and some hardware. It makes the use of the tools less abstract over time. It will be easier to keep a kid angaged by “fixing” lots of things in different ways.</p>,<p>HOWEVER!!!</p>,<p>If you are Harley guy, and there are lots of you out there, there’s always this kit:</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkctu2zAQRff5CkML7hxRjB05aZiiQR5NgSItjHZL0ORIZs2HMhxXdb--Mp0AvSvOneHhxfDGdagDzDIdPMhqdJa2143gw58PW3D9lq7F4lhUs6Cxd7EMyIq_16ehYmSDyXsXe1nFVM0Kd5PQAp7aaGRV12OeR32ug_6b4lzbfMgE4dykUE_oHijXrx_XgL-dgZ-A2aUoBectXwnBXiJ8WcuGvQyAmo6tJ6BP9jMFz75q3AF989qA_LFmOe1xOmnDEDpJnSLnmbaKDgPIAZPdG1JT2B0j1GY3pVbOyqDpV8K54CwU3FBwp7ATqD8-OcGLHSCSvOPN_dXq8eHqO9PZxfy_caQ_W7lcNBemaxZt25olF60A2Jh2IVYrvhTLlrO8TaN6W1SnfYZyU6UBYlYuqgijGl20aZSEe2ADTrtRJvmE8qKIkSP_bnF-eWk42_RvdVdU3Z7NJt3Up_--_Qea7q1M" height="244"></iframe>,<p>There’s not as many pieces, but damn! It’s a Harley kit!</p>,<p>Either way, by using toys like this, as well as doctor kits and crayons, you can immerse yourself in you own kid’s world. Let him imitate and then lead, go back and forth. If you are a first time father you will be amazed at what you learn about your son or daughter as you do this. And they will love you for it.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.</h1>,<p><em><strong>“A man doesn't have time in his life<br> to have time for everything.<br> He doesn't have seasons enough to have<br> a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes<br> Was wrong about that.”</strong></em></p>,<p>That’s an excerpt from the excellent poem <em>A Man in His Life</em> by Yehuda Amichai. It, among other works, are among the things all young men should read. It makes the clear point that life is about decisions and actions that must be taken, regardless of what life brings you.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e39a65d0-7d08-42ac-8e05-5b4c6fc2441b.jpg">,<p>A single man is every bit as burdened or blessed by these challenges as the married man. The idea that being single is a picnic is an illusion. While the partnered father may have the burden of protecting and providing for others, the motivation to do so is provided him, in that those people exist.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52a83a83-fa03-46b3-b3eb-4529800580e8.jpg">,<p>The single man must make his life, and find success and maturity through his own motivation; under his own head of steam. If he makes excuses, he makes them to ether. He cannot measure success by the love and gratitude in the eyes of others. He can only measure it through harsh self-assessment.</p>,<p>Does he have greater freedom? Of course. But he has no counterweight to help him modulate how he enjoys that freedom. He only has his own ambition and his own conscience to guide him.</p>,<p>It is as a single man he should develop his passions. If his work is his passion, he is lucky indeed, but even that isn’t enough to round him out and allow him to make the most of his world. A few days hiking the Appalachian Trail or working wood into a desk or repairing a small engine will help him to take on his professional or trade challenges afresh for the following week.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/939c7602ca30d0525896594cc4940802/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3425&cropwidth=4904&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd3d4e26b91cfaf378c347bbcedfc82a2a0717e04.jpg&x=0&y=0">,<p>And of course, unless he intends to remain single, he must balance his freedom and maneuverability against the possibility of attracting his soul mate.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Tool Kits (ages 7-11)</h1>,<p>So your child isn’t a toddler anymore. If he enjoyed his first toy tool kit, you may consider upping the game a bit. I looked at what is on the market and these items jumped out at me.</p>,<p>Amazon sometimes shows them as a combination if you pull up the woodworking kit. This kit is amazing. I have three grandchildren, a girl and two boys, one featured in the post <em><a href="http://itsamans.world/what-is-a-man" title="">What Is A Man?</a>, </em>who will soon be ready for this. Shy of having your kids work in the shop on real projects (that could get a bit dodgy), I can’t think of a better way to teach them the basics.</p>,<p>Note: The younger they are the more you’ll have to remind them that tools and lumber can’t be left around. That’s “dangerous” and can ruin a good project. “Besides”, you might say, “This is how <em><strong>real</strong></em> carpenters take care of their stuff.”</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU9vEzEQxe98imgPvqXr7rabUOoiEBIUCaVSBBIna2LPbkz8ZxlPWNJPz8ZpJd7J82b889P43vUEAReZTx5VNTnL-7vrRo5_3-3RDXu-a27ORbUIQIOLZUBV8rW-DBUjG0reuzioKqZqUbi7RBbp0iajqrqe8jLCFQR4TnEJNp8yY7gyKdQzekDO9e_3W6Q_zuAPpOxSVI2UK7luGrGJ-HWrrsVmRAI-tz4jf7BfOHjxDeiA_OTBoPq-FTkdaT6BEYS94l6z8wKs5tOIaqRkj4b1HPYgmMAc5tTaWRWAfyVaNlKEghsL7hJ2Bg3nJ2d4sQNGVh-lfPv489PqaSMgu5j_N870R6v6FladsXJ323fdykIHuGvbZn2z7kzTt7ci79OkXxbVg89Ybuo0YszaRR1x0pOLNk2K6YhipHk32iSfSLVFgh37V0vKrjNS7IaXui-qHt4sZt3Xl_9--Adve67E" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Here’s a tool kit that is an obvious step up from plactic hammers, but sized and designed for young hands.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU1vGyEQhu_9FdYeuDmLiWPni1TppUmkypEs94owDGtiPrbDOBv313eNE6nviXlneHg13HuHOsKk0DGAbAZvaXc7E7z_uNuB73Z0K-anoplEjZ1PdUA2_Ks-D1WjGMwh-NTJJuVmUrnbjBbw3EYjm7YdyjTpCx3135ym2pZjIYgXJsd2RHdApf3zfQ347g38Biw-Jyk4X_JrIdgqwctaztiqB9R0av0EerRPFAP7pXEP9Bq0AblZs5IPOJ60YQhOklPkA9NW0bEH2WO2B0NqDLtnhNrsx9TKWxk1vWWcCs5ixfUVdw47grrTkyO82hESyR-czx6fN2KzYrr4VP43TvRnK831zeWNmAs7X7qrhbmyzjjuDOdiubWCa1Z2eVCfi3I6FKg3Ve4hFeWTSjCowSebB0l4ANbjuBtlcsgoL6sYeQpfFueLheFs233Wrqp5-DYZdd-e__vhH0y9rp4" height="244"></iframe>,<p>OR</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU1vEzEQhu_8imgPvqXrLGibtHURcKBFgiJF9GpN7NmNiT-W8YQl_Hocp5UYX_y-M348Ht-5gSDgIvPJo2pmZ3l_s-rk9Od2j27c80337iyaRQAaXawFqpGv-lJUjWwoee_iqJqYmkXl7hJZpEuajGrads7LCFcQ4G-KS7D5lBnDlUmhLegRObe_3m-RfjuDz0jZpag6Ka_luuvEU8QvW7USTxMS8Dn1GfmDfeDgxVegA_J3DwbVj63I6UhlB0YQDooHzc4LsJpPE6qJkj0a1qXZg2ACcyhda2dVAP6ZaNlJESpuqrhLswU0nq8s8GoHjKw-SrnefHv89LAWkF3M_xtn-qNVIFfXG1lGurMb6LsiNqYsxJ0xfV9elfdp1i-DGsBnrCd1mjBm7aKOOOvZRZtmxXREMVGZjTbJJ1Jvawh27F8tKfveSLEbX_RQo7l_syhx117--_4f90auCw" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Why should I leave my baby girl out, right?</p>,<h2>Okay…Here’s a two-fer.

            <title><![CDATA[Storm Tracking and Brain Farts]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Storm Tracking and Brain Farts</h1>,<p>It’s been an interesting week if you like storm tracking. I follow hurricanes and snow storms and try to beat the professional meteorologists for timing and accuracy of a storm’s path. I do pretty well. I did really well with <em><strong>Matthew </strong></em>last year. The TV guys were throwing darts all over the southeast coast right up until the last possible minute. I had it pegged to weaken and hit South Carolina two days prior to landfall.</p>,<p>I started tracking Irma early on. The weather guys started talking about Irma going up the east coast days ago. But I could not see their logic. Using the same information they use, without the luxury of their computer modeling, I failed to see the prevailing conditions developing to steer the storm north until today. Even now, I don’t see an abrupt turn north.</p>,<p>In fact, from looking at isobars, the movement of a cold front sliding in and prevailing winds, upper and lower, I think the storm may slow its rate of advance and wobble a bit. It might even do a very short jog south further over western Cuba before moving north. And I only give it 50/50 shot to go into the gulf versus straight north and hard into Florida.</p>,<p>But its all a crap shoot for me. And it’s not too much better for the pros.</p>,<p>I depend on all those prevailing conditions listed above. The hard part being that you don’t know how accurately <strong>they</strong> are being predicted. When I first started tracking Irma, the front it is approaching was not a predicted factor. But you can now see it interacting with the storm in satellite imagery.</p>,<p>If Irma goes hard against that front, she will slide north as if the front and Irma had interlocking gears.</p>,<p>I am also hearing talk of wind shear. If it is strong, it will blow Irma out quickly. But again, I didn’t see that on my Intellicast maps until today and I’m not sure how strong the effect will be.</p>,<p>Still, I am prepared. We keep a storm shelter in the middle of the house. This week we topped off the water supply and I still have to go out and get extra gas for the generator.</p>,<h2>Oh, that damn generator!</h2>,<p>I went out to test run the generator today. I set the choke and slid the throttle full and pulled the starter. Nothing. Maybe I had the choke position backward. Pull. Nothing. Center choke to run. Nothing. Start cursing. That didn’t help either.</p>,<p>“Oh google!”</p>,<p>I read the user manual. Set throttle. Set choke. I had it right the first time. Pull nothing. Go to next page. And there itwas! I had forgotten this generator was equipped with a high-tech ONO-ff positioner device. “Make sure on/off switch is in on position”. Duh.</p>,<p>Okay generator’s working. I put it under a load for a bit, running some shop tools and that chore was done.</p>,<p>When you do your preps for future events (too late for Fl and TX) be sure to get gallons of water along with bottles. AND don’t get confused and get distilled water. That can injure or kill you. <strong>You don’t drink distilled water!</strong></p>,<p>Get marine-grade (boat) fuel. This will be for power equipment like chain saws, lawn tractors and generators. Regular gas has ethanol in it. Ethanol is a worthless additive we are forced by corrupt laws to put in our cars. It is not good for our cars, but it can trash small engines. And you don’t want that to happen in a pinch.</p>,<p>You should remember (as I never do) to run your generator every couple of months and put it under an electrical load. From what industrial generator experts tell me, that is not only an important test, it is good for the generator. Don’t ask me why.</p>,<p>Big D-cell flashlights are good. Bigger dry cell lamps are better. Lots of small led devices are very handy.</p>,<p>Canned meats and canned meals that are actually precooked are great to have. You can heat them up in the can. And if you are really stuck for a heat source, they can be eaten cold. If you have military style MRE’s you are in like Flynn. Rations have come a long way since I was a Beach Master in the early 80’s. I wasn’t a fan of half of what you’d find in a case of C-rats.</p>,<p>Decide ahead of time if you are going to evacuate or ride out a storm. If you decide to bug out, go early. Go as soon as evacuation talk starts. If you wait for the order you’ll be where people in the southeast are today. You’ll be sitting on a highway for possibly days.</p>,<p>There is much more to all this. I will cover it over in the next few installments along with how to create your own storm shelter and bug-out bags.</p>,<p>If you are in south Florida right now, go to shelter or as high as you can in a concrete building. If you are on the ground, at sea level you will likely have a very bad time of it.</p>,<p>Let’s hope I, <strong>and the real meteorologists, </strong>are totally wrong on this one. Let’s hope the wind sheer is kick-ass! Let’s hope that front catches a strong bite of Irma and sends her back out into the Atlantic. If it does, the worst-case scenario is that a lot of people had a really shitty road trip and life can go on.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Following the Tour de France]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Following the Tour de France</h1>,<h2>The Best Tour in YEARS!</h2>,<p>I have become a big fan of the Tour de France.  I love cycling and have always admired the super-human performances you see in these events.  That the Tour occurs in the dead of summer makes the more grueling stages that much more impressive.  (Full disclosure - even when I do participate in bicycle events, I always look for the ones that occur on the coast.  No hills.)</p>,<p>Working from home, on my own schedule has allowed me to follow the tour much more intently.   After three years of catching just about every stage, I confess I still don’t quite understand the scoring.  Nor do I understand this weird gentlemen’s agreement that you don’t break away when your arch rival is working through a mechanical problem.</p>,<p>Today, Stage 9, several riders started to attack after Chris Froome (yelow jersey leader) suffered an apparent gearing problem.  After running a few hundred yards, Dan Martin signaled to the others that this wasn’t kosher.  They actually slowed down to allow Froome and what was left of Team Sky CATCH UP!  Martin would soon pay dearly for this decision.</p>,<p>I am not altogether sure Froome would have done the same thing.  He may not have bolted, but I think he’d have at least continued his pace, having the discipline to break when it was strategically smart to do so.  But he damn sure wouldn’t have slowed his pace to WAIT for someone to get a new bike!</p>,<h2>Wicked Wreck</h2>,<p>This year’s tour has featured some horrendous climbs.  The Stage 9 final climb has been considered one of the key challenges of the entire tour.  The riders climbed for miles over several hours.  There were a few drops that would pass quickly, then it was back to climbing.  The final climb was brutal.  It is no wonder they haven’t used this particular stretch of road since the ‘70s.  </p>,<p>As the riders went over the top, they had an almost 7-mile downhill run.  Watching them maneuver through the turns made my knees weak.  I mentioned to my wife that coming out of such a long, hard climb these guys heads could be a little muddled.  The heat only accentuated the possibility.</p>,<p>Well, about halfway through a 45-50 mile-per hour run, Richie Porte caught his back wheel on the skirt of the road inside a tight left curve.  The bike went out from under him and he skidded straight across the road into a field of five other riders.  Martin had zero time to react.  Porte carried Martin and his bike straight into a rock face on the racers’ right. </p>,<p><a href="http://resources.entreprenutty.com/richie-porte-is-the-man-of-steel/" title="">If you look at the still shot in this link, it is almost impossible to tell where Porte begins and Martin ends, much less where the bike is.</a></p>,<p>Amazingly, Martin got up, grabbed a new bike from his chase car and finished just 1:15 behind the stage winner, Rigoberto Uran.</p>,<p>More amazing, Porte didn’t suffer a broken neck!  He was driven into the embankment at 45 MPH, folded in half and flipped back onto the road.  Watching the crash, I was certain he was critically injured.</p>,<p>The latest I have, as of this afternoon, he has a concussion and some bad cuts and bruises.  </p>,<p>CUTS AND BRUISES?!  One of the commentators said it best.  Imagine you are in a car moving at 45 miles and hour. You are basically wearing your underwear and a styrofoam cup on your head.  Now jump out of the car into the guard rail.</p>,<p>These guys are either supermen or VERY lucky.</p>,<p>Two other riders also crashed out of the Tour today.  Froome (remember how Martin and others stayed with him) increased his overall lead from 12 to 18 seconds.  He still has the yellow jersey.</p>,<p>With Thomas and Porte out of the race Froome’s odds of finishing the Tour with the yellow are improved.</p>]]></description>
