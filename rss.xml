            <title><![CDATA[What is a Man?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>What is a Man?</h1>,<p>There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn’t <strong>quite</strong> uniquely American, but it’s close.</p>,<p>In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT…There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cda046e5-8625-475e-a4c9-6a82b5ba424e.jpg">,<p>Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case, the typical American male is not a creature to be sneered at, but respected.</p>,<p>The man we celebrate here teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they’ll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.</p>,<p>He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he’s developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.</p>,<p>The REAL American man says “thank you” to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.</p>,<p>He isn’t arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aec9e9a1-246f-48e3-b12a-a23b001c8879.jpg">,<p>If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dcb3c7c-752a-4a15-bf93-b729bc7b8a2f.jpg">,<p>Photo credit: <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title=""> http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo</a></p>,<p>This is the man our site is dedicated to.</p>,<p><a href="http://itsamans.world/but-not-every-guy-is-married-with-kids" title="">But Not every guy is married with kids!</a></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.</h1>,<p><em><strong>“A man doesn't have time in his life<br> to have time for everything.<br> He doesn't have seasons enough to have<br> a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes<br> Was wrong about that.”</strong></em></p>,<p>That’s an excerpt from the excellent poem <em>A Man in His Life</em> by Yehuda Amichai. It, among other works, are among the things all young men should read. It makes the clear point that life is about decisions and actions that must be taken, regardless of what life brings you.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e39a65d0-7d08-42ac-8e05-5b4c6fc2441b.jpg">,<p>A single man is every bit as burdened or blessed by these challenges as the married man. The idea that being single is a picnic is an illusion. While the partnered father may have the burden of protecting and providing for others, the motivation to do so is provided him, in that those people exist.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52a83a83-fa03-46b3-b3eb-4529800580e8.jpg">,<p>The single man must make his life, and find success and maturity through his own motivation; under his own head of steam. If he makes excuses, he makes them to ether. He cannot measure success by the love and gratitude in the eyes of others. He can only measure it through harsh self-assessment.</p>,<p>Does he have greater freedom? Of course. But he has no counterweight to help him modulate how he enjoys that freedom. He only has his own ambition and his own conscience to guide him.</p>,<p>It is as a single man he should develop his passions. If his work is his passion, he is lucky indeed, but even that isn’t enough to round him out and allow him to make the most of his world. A few days hiking the Appalachian Trail or working wood into a desk or repairing a small engine will help him to take on his professional or trade challanges afresh for the following week.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/95184b24843201b63240e7a992299c76/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3426&cropwidth=4904&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9951dc6d9a6f3a243f620c09c929656abfedc806.jpg&x=30&y=0">,<p>And of course, unless he intends to remain single, he must balance his freedom and maneuverability against the possibility of attracting his soul mate. This is the hardest and most critical task of all.</p>,<p>Man Ironing</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxljtEKgjAYhV9leN9-XVNSTAyhq4heYa3pRrrJNpTevs3oIro88J3vnJs03qDOiofyFaoZklb0x0R6P7sKYF1X3I-KPy3mZoI50g7KoqBpVh7aa0qBlDQnGdnnJYWkOWlvlBaXD9kOE1NjrNbAGnTeTGhR7HcpDAVk7tUgfYSTpvvGrfd3i1vBvFpEYCejHTZ2gOAW2gkH99dO851jQHAaHnEeHW_zok1d" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Hoodie</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxlztEKwiAYBeBXkd3P39kijTWCQZfRK5hzU9pUVDZ6-9ygi-jywDkf56FdcqgLqjfpjBqBdFDDpdAp-XgGWNcVD5ORr4Clm8Fv7Qic8ZoSSq53QuBQsYqfas6ONRStdl5NKsaKsgZEi277GC1G_OLZzqAfzKjTRhdt94377u-JDEoks6jcnZ2N2IURsq1sVBGe79LK0vZAMcknpNyMD6BKR-s" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Man in a suit</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxlztEKgyAYBeBXke7n76xJRYtBsMuxV3BqKSsNlaK3nwW7GLs8cM7HeWoXHeq8kibWqOFIe9VfMx3jHGqAdV1xPxrx9li4Cea9HeBMqqJklyq_PQiFnDBWspJQWkDWcjmqDWu-rc7JBniL7sceLYb_-olP5tybQcddz9ruG4_d3xnhFY9mUak7ORuw8wMkW9mgAry2kxUnK4Fikm4IsRsfqjhJVA" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>
