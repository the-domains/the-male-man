            <title><![CDATA[The Eye Within the Eye]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Eye Within the Eye</h1>,<h2>A good photo</h2>,<p>There is something about a quality photograph that really speaks to us.</p>,<p>I know a few good photographers. And I know that if we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with identical cameras and snapped pictures of the same kid we get different results. People would look at my photos and say, “Look. cute kid.”</p>,<p>But from a photographer with a gift, they’d say something like, “I just can't stop looking at this kid. Look her eyes! You can just sense…” Or, “The eyes practically reach out of the picture…”</p>,<p>I’ve heard people say that the secret to good photography is lighting or composition or some other technical aspect. I can tell you first hand that’s not so. I’ve taken thousands of pictures in my lifetime and few actually exude life.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3d5311a5-e169-4ae8-a651-8edf5f78e2fc.jpg">,<p>No doubt, those things are important. But there is far more to it.</p>,<p>People like <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">Kathleen Roche</a> have that innate ability to give a photograph life. I envy them.</p>,<p>I use her work here and hope to do so more on the future.</p>,<p>But among the hobbies, habits and passions one may pursue, one that can bring real satisfaction as well as tangible results would have to be photography.</p>,<p>Tom Jordan, a photographer from Pennsylvania, says the he goes out and just walks. It could be on the beach, or in Philadelphia or in his favorite park (location secret) and he says, “I don’t know what I’m going to get, or where I’m going to get it, but I know that day I’m going to really nail a picture.” </p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxljtEKgjAYhV9l-AD7ly3NMAmELqNXWPPXjdJ_bEPp7ZtCF9HlgfN959wNRWKtx87GE6sVMx77c2ZidOEEsCwL719WPz3XNIJb2wFkUUl52BWXmxCwF1JWVZGXxxyyxmHnKdiRMJQ1qIZdN5rNVv3akzwZXW8HE1d31rTfuHF_V7RHFe2MqTvSFDj5AZIbp4ABHm_IuUj7Wm_0B8D6RvE" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is a Man?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>What is a Man?</h1>,<p>There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn’t <strong>quite</strong> uniquely American, but it’s close.</p>,<p>In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT…There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cda046e5-8625-475e-a4c9-6a82b5ba424e.jpg">,<p>Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case we celebrate the strong, American male role model.</p>,<p>The man we celebrate teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they’ll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.</p>,<p>He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he’s developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.</p>,<p>The REAL American man says “thank you” to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.</p>,<p>He isn’t arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aec9e9a1-246f-48e3-b12a-a23b001c8879.jpg">,<p>If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.</p>,<p>This is the man our site is dedicated to.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dcb3c7c-752a-4a15-bf93-b729bc7b8a2f.jpg">,<p>Photo credit: <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo</a></p>,<p><a href="http://itsamans.world/but-not-every-guy-is-married-with-kids" title="">But Not every guy is married with kids!</a></p>,<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>,<p>The pictures in this article gave me a thought. This website will use advertising to keep the lights on. And we will make the ads content appropriate. We won’t put an ad for an iPad in a post about chain saws.</p>,<p>Anyway, the thought. Tools kits for kids. One of the most important things I think I missed as a kid was familiarity with proper tools and their uses, and mechanical experience. I learned much of it in the Navy and I am a self-taught furniture maker. But I’d have been much further ahead of the game as a young man if someone had mentored me in <em>any</em> of the trades.</p>,<p>So here are some suggestion for bringing kids into the trades in a fun way. By “playing” with your son or daughter, going through the motions of using play tools, you not only engage them in a learning activity, you create a bond around that activity.</p>,<h2>For the Toddler:</h2>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkUFv2zAMhe_7FYEPuqVWHDdxu6pDhwHtBgwdEGxXgZZoR4sluRRTL_v1c5QW2DuJj9SnB-rOdQQeF4lPA6picpb3t6tKjn8-7tH1e76t6nNRLDxQ70IeUIV8ry9D2UiG4jC40KsixGKRuW0ki3Rpk1FFWU5pGeAKPPyNYQk2nRKjvzLRlzO6R07ly6cd0qsz-AspuRhUJeVWNlUlngN-26mVeB6RgM-tR-QH-8R-EN-BDsg_BjCofu5EikeaT2AEYae40-wGAVbzaUQ1UrRHw3oOexBMYA5zau2s8sC_Iy0rKXzGjRl3CTuD-vOTMzzbHgOrz3L1UO--rBopILmQ_jfO9K9WYd3AWm5N3dZd09xsO7ttrjebFuR1C3Z9I9I-TvptUR0MCfNNHUcMSbugA056csHGSTEdUYw070abOERS6yzBjod3S8rNxkjR9m91l1Xcf1jMuisv_33_D-41rgQ" height="244"></iframe>,<p>I chose this kit because it had a good variety of tools and some hardware. It makes the use of the tools less abstract over time. It will be easier to keep a kid angaged by “fixing” lots of things in different ways.</p>,<p>HOWEVER!!!</p>,<p>If you are Harley guy, and there are lots of you out there, there’s always this kit:</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkctu2zAQRff5CkML7hxRjB05aZiiQR5NgSItjHZL0ORIZs2HMhxXdb--Mp0AvSvOneHhxfDGdagDzDIdPMhqdJa2143gw58PW3D9lq7F4lhUs6Cxd7EMyIq_16ehYmSDyXsXe1nFVM0Kd5PQAp7aaGRV12OeR32ug_6b4lzbfMgE4dykUE_oHijXrx_XgL-dgZ-A2aUoBectXwnBXiJ8WcuGvQyAmo6tJ6BP9jMFz75q3AF989qA_LFmOe1xOmnDEDpJnSLnmbaKDgPIAZPdG1JT2B0j1GY3pVbOyqDpV8K54CwU3FBwp7ATqD8-OcGLHSCSvOPN_dXq8eHqO9PZxfy_caQ_W7lcNBemaxZt25olF60A2Jh2IVYrvhTLlrO8TaN6W1SnfYZyU6UBYlYuqgijGl20aZSEe2ADTrtRJvmE8qKIkSP_bnF-eWk42_RvdVdU3Z7NJt3Up_--_Qea7q1M" height="244"></iframe>,<p>There’s not as many pieces, but damn! It’s a Harley kit!</p>,<p>Either way, by using toys like this, as well as doctor kits and crayons, you can immerse yourself in you own kid’s world. Let him imitate and then lead, go back and forth. If you are a first time father you will be amazed at what you learn about your son or daughter as you do this. And they will love you for it.</p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.</h1>,<p><em><strong>“A man doesn't have time in his life<br> to have time for everything.<br> He doesn't have seasons enough to have<br> a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes<br> Was wrong about that.”</strong></em></p>,<p>That’s an excerpt from the excellent poem <em>A Man in His Life</em> by Yehuda Amichai. It, among other works, are among the things all young men should read. It makes the clear point that life is about decisions and actions that must be taken, regardless of what life brings you.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e39a65d0-7d08-42ac-8e05-5b4c6fc2441b.jpg">,<p>A single man is every bit as burdened or blessed by these challenges as the married man. The idea that being single is a picnic is an illusion. While the partnered father may have the burden of protecting and providing for others, the motivation to do so is provided him, in that those people exist.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52a83a83-fa03-46b3-b3eb-4529800580e8.jpg">,<p>The single man must make his life, and find success and maturity through his own motivation; under his own head of steam. If he makes excuses, he makes them to ether. He cannot measure success by the love and gratitude in the eyes of others. He can only measure it through harsh self-assessment.</p>,<p>Does he have greater freedom? Of course. But he has no counterweight to help him modulate how he enjoys that freedom. He only has his own ambition and his own conscience to guide him.</p>,<p>It is as a single man he should develop his passions. If his work is his passion, he is lucky indeed, but even that isn’t enough to round him out and allow him to make the most of his world. A few days hiking the Appalachian Trail or working wood into a desk or repairing a small engine will help him to take on his professional or trade challanges afresh for the following week.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/95184b24843201b63240e7a992299c76/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3426&cropwidth=4904&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9951dc6d9a6f3a243f620c09c929656abfedc806.jpg&x=30&y=0">,<p>And of course, unless he intends to remain single, he must balance his freedom and maneuverability against the possibility of attracting his soul mate.

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Tool Kits (ages 7-11)</h1>,<p>So your child isn’t a toddler anymore. If he enjoyed his first toy tool kit, you may consider upping the game a bit. I looked at what is on the market and these items jumped out at me.</p>,<p>Amazon sometimes shows them as a combination if you pull up the woodworking kit. This kit is amazing. I have three grandchildren, a girl and two boys, one featured in the post <em><a href="http://itsamans.world/what-is-a-man" title="">What Is A Man?</a>, </em>who will soon be ready for this. Shy of having your kids work in the shop on real projects (that could get a bit dodgy), I can’t think of a better way to teach them the basics.</p>,<p>Note: The younger they are the more you’ll have to remind them that tools and lumber can’t be left around. That’s “dangerous” and can ruin a good project. “Besides”, you might say, “This is how <em><strong>real</strong></em> carpenters take care of their stuff.”</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU9vEzEQxe98imgPvqXr7rabUOoiEBIUCaVSBBIna2LPbkz8ZxlPWNJPz8ZpJd7J82b889P43vUEAReZTx5VNTnL-7vrRo5_3-3RDXu-a27ORbUIQIOLZUBV8rW-DBUjG0reuzioKqZqUbi7RBbp0iajqrqe8jLCFQR4TnEJNp8yY7gyKdQzekDO9e_3W6Q_zuAPpOxSVI2UK7luGrGJ-HWrrsVmRAI-tz4jf7BfOHjxDeiA_OTBoPq-FTkdaT6BEYS94l6z8wKs5tOIaqRkj4b1HPYgmMAc5tTaWRWAfyVaNlKEghsL7hJ2Bg3nJ2d4sQNGVh-lfPv489PqaSMgu5j_N870R6v6FladsXJ323fdykIHuGvbZn2z7kzTt7ci79OkXxbVg89Ybuo0YszaRR1x0pOLNk2K6YhipHk32iSfSLVFgh37V0vKrjNS7IaXui-qHt4sZt3Xl_9--Adve67E" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Here’s a tool kit that is an obvious step up from plactic hammers, but sized and designed for young hands.</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU1vGyEQhu_9FdYeuDmLiWPni1TppUmkypEs94owDGtiPrbDOBv313eNE6nviXlneHg13HuHOsKk0DGAbAZvaXc7E7z_uNuB73Z0K-anoplEjZ1PdUA2_Ks-D1WjGMwh-NTJJuVmUrnbjBbw3EYjm7YdyjTpCx3135ym2pZjIYgXJsd2RHdApf3zfQ347g38Biw-Jyk4X_JrIdgqwctaztiqB9R0av0EerRPFAP7pXEP9Bq0AblZs5IPOJ60YQhOklPkA9NW0bEH2WO2B0NqDLtnhNrsx9TKWxk1vWWcCs5ixfUVdw47grrTkyO82hESyR-czx6fN2KzYrr4VP43TvRnK831zeWNmAs7X7qrhbmyzjjuDOdiubWCa1Z2eVCfi3I6FKg3Ve4hFeWTSjCowSebB0l4ANbjuBtlcsgoL6sYeQpfFueLheFs233Wrqp5-DYZdd-e__vhH0y9rp4" height="244"></iframe>,<p>OR</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxNkU1vEzEQhu_8imgPvqXrLGibtHURcKBFgiJF9GpN7NmNiT-W8YQl_Hocp5UYX_y-M348Ht-5gSDgIvPJo2pmZ3l_s-rk9Od2j27c80337iyaRQAaXawFqpGv-lJUjWwoee_iqJqYmkXl7hJZpEuajGrads7LCFcQ4G-KS7D5lBnDlUmhLegRObe_3m-RfjuDz0jZpag6Ka_luuvEU8QvW7USTxMS8Dn1GfmDfeDgxVegA_J3DwbVj63I6UhlB0YQDooHzc4LsJpPE6qJkj0a1qXZg2ACcyhda2dVAP6ZaNlJESpuqrhLswU0nq8s8GoHjKw-SrnefHv89LAWkF3M_xtn-qNVIFfXG1lGurMb6LsiNqYsxJ0xfV9elfdp1i-DGsBnrCd1mjBm7aKOOOvZRZtmxXREMVGZjTbJJ1Jvawh27F8tKfveSLEbX_RQo7l_syhx117--_4f90auCw" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Why should I leave my baby girl out, right?</p>,<h2>Okay…Here’s a two-fer.

            <title><![CDATA[The Dog Mystique (Part 1)]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Dog Mystique (Part 1)</h1>,<h2>Bred to Love</h2>,<p>One of my pet peeves is poor dog stewardship. A dog is a highly intelligent, social animal. They have been bred, for the most part, in protected domestic environments since before Egypt was a spec on the map.</p>,<p>For this reason, they have evolved into loyal, useful animals who bond significantly with their human families. As a result of this breeding and evolution, they have needs that must be met if they are to be healthy and happy.</p>,<h2>Some People Should Own Dogs</h2>,<p>I have never understood the people who buy a dog, put him in the yard with a bowl of water and forget the animal exists. What is the point? I have had two neighbors over the years who were that kind of dog owners. One kept two dogs in his yard. The only interaction I ever witnessed between the man the the dogs was when he would open the back door and yell at them to “shut up” when they were barking.</p>,<p>What the hell did he expect? They needed interaction and stimulation. They’d ask for from anything outside the yard they were ignored in. When they did, they would hear that man bark at them. Ridiculous. I he couldn’t figure out for the life of him why his dogs were diggers and constantly trying to escape the yard.</p>,<p>The reason, of course, is because he didn’t know Jack Sh@* about the proper care of dogs.</p>,<p>There was another neighbor who keep a dog on a cable lead in a small field across from his apartment. Every morning this fat pant load (or his fat, pant load wife) would lumber actoss the street with a bucket and some food. He’d dump the water and the food and walk away while the dog pathetically begged him to stop and interact in some way.</p>,<p>The only shelter was a plastic barrel tipped on its side. On cold mornings I wold see the dog perched, all fours, on a piece of cinder block. The mud was so cold and uncomfortable it would do that just to avoid the mud.</p>,<p>Ostensibly, this was a dog kept for hunting. That slob didn’t hunt. He’d have had a heart attack hunting for the TV remote.</p>,<p>We called the county to have to have dog removed but they said it was <em><strong>legal</strong></em> in Spotsylvania to keep a dog that way.</p>,<p>Back then I had a sensitive job and a sense that I should mind my own business. But if I had it to do all over again, I’d take a treat and a set of cable cutters over free the dog for myself or for the local shelter. If I see dogs treated like that in the future I’ll do just that and deal with the punks keeping the dog on whatever level they with to be dealt with. Violent confrontation wold be a bonus - for me.</p>,<p>Dogs are special. I read a piece today that actor Tom Hardy posted on Tumblr. It speaks to this special trust a dog places in it’s protectors. And it portrays the joy these sweet animal bring to our lives. <a href="http://tomhardydotorg.tumblr.com/post/161532868851/i-first-saw-woodstock-running-across-a-turnpike-we" title="">Take a minute to read it.</a></p>,<p>Look for posts here about pet ownership and care. Try to appreciate the responsibility required of you before you ever go to the pound or the breeder to get a pet - especially one as interactive as a dog.</p>,<p>We’ll talk again soon.</p>,<h2>Talk about content appropriate!

            <title><![CDATA[Laugh All You Want, But Try It Anyway.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Laugh All You Want, But Try It Anyway.</h1>,<p>Do you remember how we all used to laugh at “preppers” and survivalists?  Yeah, the original guys were often a bit odd, trying their best to look like cast members of Duck Dynasty.  And they were often too political for most people.  But you can’t deny the huge market niche that has been created in the area of survival, safety and security.  Most of this industry’s better ideas are thanks to those guys we treated as punchlines.</p>,<p>I want you to keep that in mind as we talk today.</p>,<h2>1.  The Butterfly Boys</h2>,<p>In the Philippines the women had a label for guys who never stayed with the same girl.  They called them butterfly boys.  The type that went from one girl to the next.  If you were honest and told them upfront your were butterfly boy they would be okay with it and decide if they wanted to date you anyway.  BUT if you didn’t tell them and still went from girl to girl while dating them…well…let’s just say many of those ladies were handy with a butterfly <em><strong>knife.  </strong></em>Nasty weapon.</p>,<p>There are butterfly boys everywhere.  Here, guys go from girl to girl.  Some do it because they can without regard for a woman’s feelings.  Depending on the type of girl you are dating, we can just call that your thing.  If you take advantage of females and lie to them outright, you’re an asshole.</p>,<p>But this section is for the butterfly boys who don’t intend to be that.  They go from girl to girl because they keep picking up the wrong girls, sometimes too few of even those.  But when they do meet women, they pick the low-hanging fruit.  They operate from a fear of rejection and pick someone who they feel confident about, who might be “needy” enough to spend time with them.  They are bronze medal picks, sometimes silver, never gold medal material.</p>,<p>This being a terrible way to chose company, it usually ends with an early exit.  Both parties are disappointed.  But what if you had the moxie and the know-how to meet the girl who usually intimidates you - I am talking about the one you are <em><strong>sure</strong></em> wouldn’t give you  a second look - and walk away her?</p>,<p>First, to allay a bit of your disbelief, I’ll say that she is likely as full of shit as anyone.  And at first glance, she isn’t thinking about your faults.  She, like every other person on the planet, is worried about her own.</p>,<p>So what can you do with this information?  Just <a href="http://ec68dcrerns4th98ncpev10ib9.hop.clickbank.net/" title="">click here.</a>  And if you find yourself feeling a bit incredulous, remember the “preppers”.</p>,<h2>For the More Mature Male</h2>,<p>For whatever reason, career, divorce or worse, many of us find ourselves middle-aged or older and alone.  We’ve been out to the game for years or decades.  Our friends, bless their meddling hearts, try their best to help but we don’t have that perfect person we need in our lives.  </p>,<p>Guys in this position are rarely looking for the low-hanging fruit; the easy score.</p>,<p>But you’re not a spring chicken.  You lost your sixpack and often most of your hair.  What are you to do?</p>,<p>Well, think about those older guys, none too good-looking, you see at resorts and fancy restaurants with the cute young thing hanging on their every word.  Did he get her because of his money?  Nope.  That only gets you discreet dates and never lasts. He got her because of the attitude his wealth allowed him to take.  It’s all about attitude and what you communicate in the first few minutes or seconds after meeting a gold-medal girl that will decide what happens next.</p>,<p>There are lots of guys our age, with not much going for them, with trophy wives who adore them.</p>,<p><a href="http://ec68dcrerns4th98ncpev10ib9.hop.clickbank.net/" title="">This is for my middle-aged bros. Click here. </a></p>,<p>And again…I laughed at the “preppers”…before I bought my first multi-purpose walking stick or firearm.  They have served me well.</p>,<p>All the best guys!</p>,<p>Disclaimer:  Many of the links you see on this site have a fiduciary relationship with itsamans.world.
