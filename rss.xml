            <title><![CDATA[The Eye Within the Eye]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>The Eye Within the Eye</h1>,<h2>A good photo</h2>,<p>There is something about a quality photograph that really speaks to us.</p>,<p>I know a few good photographers. And I know that if we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with identical cameras and snapped pictures of the same kid we get different results. People would look at my photos and say, “Look. cute kid.”</p>,<p>But from a photographer with a gift, they’d say something like, “I just can't stop looking at this kid. Look her eyes! You can just sense…” Or, “The eyes practically reach out of the picture…”</p>,<p>I’ve heard people say that the secret to good photography is lighting or composition or some other technical aspect. I can tell you first hand that’s not so. I’ve taken thousands of pictures in my lifetime and few actually exude life.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3d5311a5-e169-4ae8-a651-8edf5f78e2fc.jpg">,<p>No doubt, those things are important. But there is far more to it.</p>,<p>People like <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">Kathleen Roche</a> have that innate ability to give a photograph life. I envy them.</p>,<p>I use her work here and hope to do so more on the future.</p>,<p>But among the hobbies, habits and passions one may pursue, one that can bring real satisfaction as well as tangible results would have to be photography.</p>,<p>Tom Jordan, a photographer from Pennsylvania, says the he goes out and just walks. It could be on the beach, or in Philadelphia or in his favorite park (location secret) and he says, “I don’t know what I’m going to get, or where I’m going to get it, but I know that day I’m going to really nail a picture.” </p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxljtEKgjAYhV9l-AD7ly3NMAmELqNXWPPXjdJ_bEPp7ZtCF9HlgfN959wNRWKtx87GE6sVMx77c2ZidOEEsCwL719WPz3XNIJb2wFkUUl52BWXmxCwF1JWVZGXxxyyxmHnKdiRMJQ1qIZdN5rNVv3akzwZXW8HE1d31rTfuHF_V7RHFe2MqTvSFDj5AZIbp4ABHm_IuUj7Wm_0B8D6RvE" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[What is a Man?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>What is a Man?</h1>,<p>There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn’t <strong>quite</strong> uniquely American, but it’s close.</p>,<p>In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT…There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cda046e5-8625-475e-a4c9-6a82b5ba424e.jpg">,<p>Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case, the typical American male is not a creature to be sneered at, but respected.</p>,<p>The man we celebrate here teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they’ll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.</p>,<p>He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he’s developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.</p>,<p>The REAL American man says “thank you” to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.</p>,<p>He isn’t arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aec9e9a1-246f-48e3-b12a-a23b001c8879.jpg">,<p>If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9dcb3c7c-752a-4a15-bf93-b729bc7b8a2f.jpg">,<p>Photo credit: <a href="http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo" title="">http://kathleenroche.wixsite.com/photo</a></p>,<p>This is the man our site is dedicated to.</p>,<p><a href="http://itsamans.world/but-not-every-guy-is-married-with-kids" title="">But Not every guy is married with kids!</a></p>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<h1>…But Not Every Guy is Married With Kids.</h1>,<p><em><strong>“A man doesn't have time in his life<br> to have time for everything.<br> He doesn't have seasons enough to have<br> a season for every purpose. Ecclesiastes<br> Was wrong about that.”</strong></em></p>,<p>That’s an excerpt from the excellent poem <em>A Man in His Life</em> by Yehuda Amichai. It, among other works, are among the things all young men should read. It makes the clear point that life is about decisions and actions that must be taken, regardless of what life brings you.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e39a65d0-7d08-42ac-8e05-5b4c6fc2441b.jpg">,<p>A single man is every bit as burdened or blessed by these challenges as the married man. The idea that being single is a picnic is an illusion. While the partnered father may have the burden of protecting and providing for others, the motivation to do so is provided him, in that those people exist.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/52a83a83-fa03-46b3-b3eb-4529800580e8.jpg">,<p>The single man must make his life, and find success and maturity through his own motivation; under his own head of steam. If he makes excuses, he makes them to ether. He cannot measure success by the love and gratitude in the eyes of others. He can only measure it through harsh self-assessment.</p>,<p>Does he have greater freedom? Of course. But he has no counterweight to help him modulate how he enjoys that freedom. He only has his own ambition and his own conscience to guide him.</p>,<p>It is as a single man he should develop his passions. If his work is his passion, he is lucky indeed, but even that isn’t enough to round him out and allow him to make the most of his world. A few days hiking the Appalachian Trail or working wood into a desk or repairing a small engine will help him to take on his professional or trade challanges afresh for the following week.</p>,<img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/2b2431f8e7ba7b0/95184b24843201b63240e7a992299c76/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=3426&cropwidth=4904&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F9951dc6d9a6f3a243f620c09c929656abfedc806.jpg&x=30&y=0">,<p>And of course, unless he intends to remain single, he must balance his freedom and maneuverability against the possibility of attracting his soul mate. This is the hardest and most critical task of all.</p>,<p>Man Ironing</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxljtEKgjAYhV9leN9-XVNSTAyhq4heYa3pRrrJNpTevs3oIro88J3vnJs03qDOiofyFaoZklb0x0R6P7sKYF1X3I-KPy3mZoI50g7KoqBpVh7aa0qBlDQnGdnnJYWkOWlvlBaXD9kOE1NjrNbAGnTeTGhR7HcpDAVk7tUgfYSTpvvGrfd3i1vBvFpEYCejHTZ2gOAW2gkH99dO851jQHAaHnEeHW_zok1d" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Hoodie</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxlztEKwiAYBeBXkd3P39kijTWCQZfRK5hzU9pUVDZ6-9ygi-jywDkf56FdcqgLqjfpjBqBdFDDpdAp-XgGWNcVD5ORr4Clm8Fv7Qic8ZoSSq53QuBQsYqfas6ONRStdl5NKsaKsgZEi277GC1G_OLZzqAfzKjTRhdt94377u-JDEoks6jcnZ2N2IURsq1sVBGe79LK0vZAMcknpNyMD6BKR-s" height="244"></iframe>,<p>Man in a suit</p>,<iframe src="https://the-grid.github.io/ed-userhtml/?g=eJxlztEKgyAYBeBXke7n76xJRYtBsMuxV3BqKSsNlaK3nwW7GLs8cM7HeWoXHeq8kibWqOFIe9VfMx3jHGqAdV1xPxrx9li4Cea9HeBMqqJklyq_PQiFnDBWspJQWkDWcjmqDWu-rc7JBniL7sceLYb_-olP5tybQcddz9ruG4_d3xnhFY9mUak7ORuw8wMkW9mgAry2kxUnK4Fikm4IsRsfqjhJVA" height="244"></iframe>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Geeks and Gadgetry</h1>,<h1><strong>When Garage Doors Attack!</strong></h1>,<h2><em>Technology wonks are talking about the “internet of things”
or the “internet of everything.”&nbsp; It’s
heady stuff.&nbsp; I have to admit, I have
been utterly fascinated by it for some time now.&nbsp; If you let your mind wander just a bit, you
can quickly get overwhelmed with the possibilities.&nbsp; Everything from driving to lawn work to
woodworking to kitchen appliances becomes a futuristic toy land.</em></h2>,<p>Imagine moving a lawn mower, with state of the art, long
lasting batteries, through all the obstacles and boundaries you face while
mowing your lawn?&nbsp; You press enter and
off it goes.&nbsp; It has sensors that track
the topography it will travel over and auto-adjusts up and down to avoid blade
strike on edges and tree roots.&nbsp; After it
finishes, it parks itself on a charger until you tap your cell phone to open
the garage door and assign it to go out and mow the lawn again.&nbsp; There is even a device that will render the
mower useless if someone tries to steal it from you.&nbsp; It will only mow YOUR lawn.&nbsp; You’ll never push a mower again.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c57ca58b-e280-4e06-981a-9e962c06ad9d.jpg" title="Is there a sneaky bot on your living room wall?" alt="Even your programmable thermostat can be hijacked for use in malware attacks.">,<p>&nbsp;As sure as you are sitting here, that technology will be
here very soon.&nbsp; We already have robotic
mowers and they are going to get smarter by the season. </p>,<p>&nbsp;Now what can the pointy-headed geeks do with weed eaters?&nbsp; Solve that problem and you will be gods!!!</p>,<p>&nbsp;We’ve got door locks, door openers, security systems and climate
controls that have been networked.&nbsp; These
systems come with their own logics and IP addresses.&nbsp; That is the amazing thing about them.&nbsp; It is also their Achilles Heel. </p>,<p>&nbsp;There is a growing menace out there in the ether.&nbsp; Malware programs that crawl the web looking for unprotected targets are finding fertile ground in the logic circuits of
these wonderful toys and tools.</p>,<p>&nbsp;It is one thing to protect your laptop and phone
from marauding hackers.But to date most
of the networked conveniences we are starting to use are governed through
simple network cards, awaiting orders to hit them wirelessly.</p>,<p><a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/sd-me-hackable-home-20161003-story.html " title="">As Eli Blumenthal and Elizabeth Weise report in
USA Today,</a>  these devices are use by hackers to create botnets, networks
of robots, really, to launch amazingly effective Denial of Service (DOS)
attacks on some pretty heavy hitters, as well as attacking John Doe’s auto
mechanics blog.</p>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/178c106e-16c1-41d9-acd4-2d13af64e105.jpg">,<p><a href="http:// http//www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/science/sd-me-hackable-home-20161003-story.html" title="">Gary Robins of the San Diego Union-Tribune</a>
says, “Some experts describe&nbsp;the attack as a threat
to&nbsp;free speech, and it underscores&nbsp;that there’s a&nbsp;quickly
emerging dark side to the widely dubbed&nbsp;Internet of Things —&nbsp;everyday
devices that are connected to the web&nbsp;or to each other.”</p>,<p>&nbsp;I’m just itching for device that pours me a drink and
operates my entertainment system from voice commands from my cell phone, but
until the industry comes up with firewalls and closed encoding for such toys,
it may be a good idea to sit tight.&nbsp; If
you insist on having a networked foot massager/robotic dog, you will have to
accept the risk that the dog may pack one hell of a bite someday.</p>,<p>&nbsp;Scary. Kinda makes you wonder if the Luddites have the right idea after all.</p>,<p><em>Thermostat</em></p>,<pre><code>Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843@N03/28450259580/&quot;&gt;rsaxvc&lt;/a&gt; Flickr via &lt;a href=&quot;http://compfight.com&quot;&gt;Compfight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>,<p>Laptop</p>,<pre><code>Photo Credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/47854931@N00/527602437/&quot;&gt;@boetter&lt;/a&gt; Flickr via &lt;a href=&quot;http://compfight.com&quot;&gt;Compfight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;&gt;cc&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>]]></description>
