# The Dog Mystique (Part 1)

## Bred to Love

One of my pet peeves is poor dog stewardship. A dog is a highly intelligent, social animal. They have been bred, for the most part, in protected domestic environments since before Egypt was a spec on the map.

For this reason, they have evolved into loyal, useful animals who bond significantly with their human families. As a result of this breeding and evolution, they have needs that must be met if they are to be healthy and happy.

## Some People Should Own Dogs

I have never understood the people who buy a dog, put him in the yard with a bowl of water and forget the animal exists. What is the point? I have had two neighbors over the years who were that kind of dog owners. One kept two dogs in his yard. The only interaction I ever witnessed between the man the the dogs was when he would open the back door and yell at them to "shut up" when they were barking.

What the hell did he expect? They needed interaction and stimulation. They'd ask for from anything outside the yard they were ignored in. When they did, they would hear that man bark at them. Ridiculous. I he couldn't figure out for the life of him why his dogs were diggers and constantly trying to escape the yard.

The reason, of course, is because he didn't know Jack Sh@\* about the proper care of dogs.

There was another neighbor who keep a dog on a cable lead in a small field across from his apartment. Every morning this fat pant load (or his fat, pant load wife) would lumber actoss the street with a bucket and some food. He'd dump the water and the food and walk away while the dog pathetically begged him to stop and interact in some way.

The only shelter was a plastic barrel tipped on its side. On cold mornings I wold see the dog perched, all fours, on a piece of cinder block. The mud was so cold and uncomfortable it would do that just to avoid the mud.

Ostensibly, this was a dog kept for hunting. That slob didn't hunt. He'd have had a heart attack hunting for the TV remote.

We called the county to have to have dog removed but they said it was _**legal**_ in Spotsylvania to keep a dog that way.

Back then I had a sensitive job and a sense that I should mind my own business. But if I had it to do all over again, I'd take a treat and a set of cable cutters over free the dog for myself or for the local shelter. If I see dogs treated like that in the future I'll do just that and deal with the punks keeping the dog on whatever level they with to be dealt with. Violent confrontation wold be a bonus - for me.

Dogs are special. I read a piece today that actor Tom Hardy posted on Tumblr. It speaks to this special trust a dog places in it's protectors. And it portrays the joy these sweet animal bring to our lives. [Take a minute to read it.][0]

Look for posts here about pet ownership and care. Try to appreciate the responsibility required of you before you ever go to the pound or the breeder to get a pet - especially one as interactive as a dog.

We'll talk again soon.
