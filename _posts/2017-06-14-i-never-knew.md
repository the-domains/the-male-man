# I never knew...

...Or maybe I did and ignored reality.

After spending two years glued to my desk and ruining all the work I did at the gym in 2015 (my best results EVER!), I decided to start looking into good ideas that will improve my overall condition and still keep my pace in the office.

Lifting weights is fine, I go to the gym 3 times a week. Aerobics are critical, of course. I am up to 1.5 miles three times a week plus yard work. If I push mow the whole property, that's 7 miles with the mower!

BUT- what I am finding is some of the simplest fixes that will improve my overall health, strength and appearance have nothing to do with how much I can lift, or how far I can walk or run. For example, just working my hip flexors will do more than keep my hips loose and comfortable...much more!

If you care about your health, I have a new resource for you. And this can be your first step.

Cool!
