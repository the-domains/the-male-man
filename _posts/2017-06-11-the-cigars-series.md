# The Cigars Series

## There is more to the story of cigars than fancy names and damp boxes. A good Aficianado should be able to address some of the salient points of his pursuits. Pick up some interesting factoids Dr. Jim. Impress you cigar buddies. Perhaps teach a newbie the meaning of a fine cigar.
