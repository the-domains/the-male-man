# **Cigars: A Brief History (Part 3)**

## **The Boom Continues**

As cigar sales grew, so did the girth (measured in ring gauge) of the most-popular smokes. One retailer said that in 1990, almost 80 percent of his sales came from the very
slim lonsdales and coronas sizes. By 1996, most of his sales came from fat
robustos and corona gordas. The first edition of _Cigar Aficionado_
magazine rated 17 robustos, the fattest of which had a ring gauge of 52\. The
Diamond Crown brand, a line consisting entirely of 54-ring gauge cigars, made
news in 1995 when it was launched---as 54s were considered quite thick in those
days. Today, a ring gauge of 60 characterizes one of the most popular sizes in
American smoke shops.

The effects of the cigar boom reached Cuba as well. Consumers flocked to Cuban cigar stores and bought every cigar they could find. On a trip to Havana in early 1996, the _Cigar Aficionado_ editors visited nine cigar shops and couldn't find a double
corona, Montecristo No. 2 or Partagás Serie D No. 4\. Cuba, which had produced
fewer than 60 million export-quality cigars in 1993 and 1994, vastly increased
its production. Cuban cigar exports reached 100 million units in 1997, and
officials announced the long-term goal of increasing further to 200 million
cigars by the year 2000\.

In November 1996, Cuba launched the Cuaba brand, the first new brand from the island in nearly 30 years. That was soon followed by such creations as Vegas Robaina, Trinidad and San Cristobal de la Habana. Cuba opened new cigar factories and vastly
increased plantings of tobacco. Alas, the mandate to pump out cigars at such a
rate resulted in a rash of inferior product.

Wall Street soon took an interest in cigars, and six cigar companies went public in 1996\. Newcomer Caribbean Cigar Co. became the first stand-alone public cigar company with its August 1, 1996 initial public offering. Sixteen days later, high-profile
financier Ronald Perelman took his Consolidated Cigar Holdings public for $23 a
share. Machine-made giant Swisher International Group Inc., the cigar retailers
JR and Holts, and even a one-year-old company named Tamboril soon followed
suit.

By 1995, more than 25 million cigars were on back order, and in 1996, that number was more than 50 million. Cigar brands such as Arturo Fuente and La Gloria Cubana became
impossible to find. For six weeks of the summer of 1996, General Cigar didn't
ship a single Macanudo cigar, the best-selling premium cigar in the United
States at the time. "We were using tobacco so rapidly we got caught. We didn't
have enough in the aging blend," said then-company president Austin T. McNamara.

The influx of boom-time smokes often meant substandard product. The April 1997
Cigar Insider had ratings for 50 cigars and, for the first time since
publication began in January 1996, not one scored 90 points or more. Low
ratings abounded, with a trio of 83s and one of the most expensive cigars in
the issue---a $6.25 effort from a Canary Islands brand called Goya---scored 82
points.

Newcomers arrived in droves, cash in tow, in Honduras, Nicaragua and especially the Dominican Republic, hoping to make a quick profit on the boom. New factories appeared
across the Dominican Republic, hiring away talented cigar makers. Some
factories ran double shifts to keep up with demand, and it became a battle to
find tobacco, cellophane, cedar boxes---everything used to make a premium cigar.
Tobacco companies planted seeds in such unlikely places as Peru, Colombia,
Panama, even Canada, and cigar factories opened in Indonesia, Ecuador and
elsewhere. The once enemic industry trade show expanded from a few dozen booths
to hundreds, and some enterprising attendees went so far as to sell their
badges to those hoping to get inside. There were more than a few quirky market
launches, among them cigar vending machines (created by two separate companies
in 1997) and a line of cigars aimed at female cigar lovers called Cleopatra,
which never quite got out of the planning stages.

Cigar sales had grown at an untenable pace. It was 1997 when the cigar industry started to catch up to the demand for cigars. The established companies began filling all the back
orders for traditional cigar brands, a number that turned out to be inflated as
cigar retailers had over-ordered through the boom, asking for 10 boxes, say, in
hopes of receiving five. As the old-time brand names filled up the distribution
chain, most of the newcomers found themselves in a pinch.

When the big-name brands caught up with demand, many of the cigars without pedigree no longer interested cigar lovers. By 1998, the discount retailers were buying up
unwanted cigars from new manufacturers who suddenly found themselves without
customers. Mark Goldman of House of Oxford Distributors set up a table in the
Gran Almirante Hotel in Santiago in 1998 and bought cigars that had once
retailed for $200 a box for as little as $7\. "Basically, we've been buying
cigars for less than it costs to make them," he said at the time.

Imports dipped as the market struggled to absorb all the cigars that had been made in the dizzying, final days of the cigar boom, falling to 248.3 million cigars in 1999\. At the
same time, the Wall Street love affair with cigars came to an end. (The cigar
industry is a long-term business, in which tobacco bought today might not be
sold for two or more years---a poor match for the stock market, which seeks gains
in every quarter.) Swisher bought back its stock in 1999, JR Cigar went private
the following year and Holt's followed suit in 2001\.

Europe's Tabacalera S.A. had bought heavily in the U.S. cigar industry, investing at the very peak of the market. The company spent more than $350 million on three deals,
including an eye-popping $27 million on two Central American factories owned by
Nestor Plasencia. When the market began to cool, the European influence grew.
In 1999, France's SEITA S.A. acquired Consolidated Cigar for $730 million.
SEITA merged later that year with Tabacalera in a $3.3 billion deal that
created Altadis, which then bought half of Cuba's Habanos S.A., and was itself
acquired by Imperial Tobacco PLC.  
Altadis rival Swedish Match AB, which bought the La Gloria Cubana brand in
1997, acquired General Cigar in a two-part deal beginning in 1999\.
