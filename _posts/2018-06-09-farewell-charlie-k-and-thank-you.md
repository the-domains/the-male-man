# Farewell Charlie K, and Thank You.

Just when I thought my day couldn't grow darker (I am in the second day of an unsuccessful search for a lost and beloved dog) I learned Charles Krauthammer has written his farewell to readers, listeners and colleagues.  Soon another great voice
will go silent.

I won't quote his open letter here.  One cheapens a product by producing too much
of it.  But it is all over the Google machine.  You should read it.  You'll find it uplifting and instructive.

He is handling his fast-approaching death with the same character and class he displays every time he puts pen to paper.  The truth is the truth.  Don't cry about it -- face it; live it.  But Charles would also admonish you to not overlook the value of living in denial when it moves you closer to your real goals.  

I am embarrassed by my present attitude as I write this. My dog took off yesterday and I want to torch the whole county.  As a first-year med student, Charles broke his neck diving.  Before his friends pulled him out of the water he had already diagnosed his condition come to terms with what the rest of his life would consist of.  

This is a man who completed his Medical degree studying three books at a time lying under a piece of Plexiglas so his page-turning nurses and orderlies wouldn't have to turn pages so often. He shot straight to the top of the psychiatric community before having the marbles to completely shift his career to journalism... only to receive a Pulitzer in the process.

Marbles!

Will I take this time to reflect on my own life and how I face challenges? Not likely. I am a hotheaded, stubborn man.  I like stringing creative expletives together. It makes me feel better.  But as the blue haze of cuss words fades, I always look to men like Krauthammer for the inspiration to get up tomorrow and do it all again.

I have spent years paging through sites looking for his latest stuff.  I read his last book and enjoyed it thoroughly.  From the first essay, Krauthammer became one of the big three on my list of favorite writers alongside Hitchens and Buckley.  All three could express in a carefully crafted paragraph what it would take mortals like myself three chapters to say.  And they would do a better job. And they made it look so easy!

Okay, I'll admit my work as a standard of measure isn't a very high bar, but you get my meaning.

While in my heart I know I am just a wide-eyed fan, having read - and often reread - so much of his work, I feel as if I am losing a friend.  And it is not lost on me that I have the opportunity to write this tribute while Charles is still alive, something I couldn't do with Hitch and Buckley.  I flatter myself that someone might show this to him and he might enjoy it.

In case that should happen, Charles, I wish you happiness and serenity for the remaining time you have. I wish your family every good thing in life.  

You truly will be missed (said the lesser author, unable to
come up with a more impressive phrase).
