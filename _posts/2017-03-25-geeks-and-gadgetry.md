# Geeks and Gadgetry

# **When Garage Doors Attack!**

## _Technology wonks are talking about the "internet of things"
or the "internet of everything."  It's
heady stuff.  I have to admit, I have
been utterly fascinated by it for some time now.  If you let your mind wander just a bit, you
can quickly get overwhelmed with the possibilities.  Everything from driving to lawn work to
woodworking to kitchen appliances becomes a futuristic toy land._

Imagine moving a lawn mower, with state of the art, long
lasting batteries, through all the obstacles and boundaries you face while
mowing your lawn?  You press enter and
off it goes.  It has sensors that track
the topography it will travel over and auto-adjusts up and down to avoid blade
strike on edges and tree roots.  After it
finishes, it parks itself on a charger until you tap your cell phone to open
the garage door and assign it to go out and mow the lawn again.  There is even a device that will render the
mower useless if someone tries to steal it from you.  It will only mow YOUR lawn.  You'll never push a mower again.
![Even your programmable thermostat can be hijacked for use in malware attacks.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c57ca58b-e280-4e06-981a-9e962c06ad9d.jpg)

As sure as you are sitting here, that technology will be
here very soon.  We already have robotic
mowers and they are going to get smarter by the season. 

Now what can the pointy-headed geeks do with weed eaters?  Solve that problem and you will be gods!!!

We've got door locks, door openers, security systems and climate
controls that have been networked.  These
systems come with their own logics and IP addresses.  That is the amazing thing about them.  It is also their Achilles Heel. 

There is a growing menace out there in the ether.  Malware programs that crawl the web looking for unprotected targets are finding fertile ground in the logic circuits of
these wonderful toys and tools.

It is one thing to protect your laptop and phone
from marauding hackers.But to date most
of the networked conveniences we are starting to use are governed through
simple network cards, awaiting orders to hit them wirelessly.

[As Eli Blumenthal and Elizabeth Weise report in
USA Today,][0] these devices are use by hackers to create botnets, networks
of robots, really, to launch amazingly effective Denial of Service (DOS)
attacks on some pretty heavy hitters, as well as attacking John Doe's auto
mechanics blog.

[Gary Robins of the San Diego Union-Tribune][1]
says, "Some experts describe the attack as a threat
to free speech, and it underscores that there's a quickly
emerging dark side to the widely dubbed Internet of Things --- everyday
devices that are connected to the web or to each other."

I'm just itching for device that pours me a drink and
operates my entertainment system from voice commands from my cell phone, but
until the industry comes up with firewalls and closed encoding for such toys,
it may be a good idea to sit tight.  If
you insist on having a networked foot massager/robotic dog, you will have to
accept the risk that the dog may pack one hell of a bite someday.

Scary. Kinda makes you wonder if the Luddites have the right idea after all.
