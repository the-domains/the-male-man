# Help the dogs! Report the posts!

_Caveat: There will be many Facebook goofballs who will not read this post but will say stupid things about it. It will be interesting to see how many. And every time it happens I'll call them out._

The military spawns lots of cool admonishments. One, in particular is appropriate here: _Don't bring me problems. Bring me solutions._

When I see these sadistic dog beating posts on Facebook, I see no valid solutions in their posting.

There are three basic types of people who share these videos.

1\. **The hopelessly naïve do-gooder.**

Thesepeople believe that by posting the videos, people will rise up in righteous indignation. The culprit will be brought to justice. At the beginning of these posts are phrases like "justice for innocent animals" or, "punish the criminal who beats innocent dog"and so on.

If you have shared these posts, here's why you are so naïve. These videos clearly take place in shit hole countries, or at least shit hole cities in other countries. One possible exception is the pig whore on the elevator stomping a puppy. She looked like she might be home-grown shit. But deep down, you know nothing will come of your post; no justice, no resolution. So you are part of the problem.

2\. **The Bringer of Bad News.**

There is an odd quirk in human nature - the desire to be the first to bring bad news. I believe it is tied into the immature urge to be a part of the narrative.

It is that tendency on display when we talk about where we were when JFK was shot or when the Twin Towers were hit. How is that important? The fact that you were in your kitchen eating Wheaties doesn't make you a part of the historical event. Similarly, the fact that you found and shared sick-ass videos makes you feel like you have your finger on the pulse and you were the "firstest with the mostest" when you served a maggot by sharing it. In reality like the other two types of posters here, you are part of the dog-beating problem, not the solution.

_To groups 1 and 2: There is a reason news outlets don't cover suicides. When they do, no matter how much they shake their heads and go on about how tragic it all is, **suicides go up**! Solution = don't share the video! Even commenting or tacking on an angry emoticon gives the post more play on FB. So don't do it. Report the post as violent and demand Facebook to take it down._

3\. **The Happy Enabler.**

This poster is as worthless and irredeemable as the people who video themselves beating the dogs. Sure, they'll put in a caption like "justice for animals" or some lame shit, but in reality they are getting off watching the video and masturbating at the idea of sharing it. They just put the bullshit caption on it to try to evade the FB police. As coarse as we have become as info consumers, I would bet the number of people in this third category is depressingly high. Assholes!

The fact is, no matter your personal motivation, the net result of your immature urge to be a part of the narrative is the maggots beating the animals going viral, which is precisely what the maggots want. You gave them that gift so you could feel important. And as the videos go viral, you give **the next sick piece of shit** the incentive to make his own dog-beating video.

As I said, if you want to be really productive, bring the solution. For example, if you have the name and address of the maggot doing the beating, publish it. With a bit of luck, you might reach that one cop in a hundred in one of these shit holes who will take the initiative to deal with the offender. Or if the world is _really_ lucky, a very large dog lover will visit the beater and grind his pathetic ass into a fine paste. Who knows, maybe their house will accidentally burn down with them in it.

You may ask why I think it is okay to berate the worthless garbage for beating a dog and then wishing them dead. Here's the reason: This kind of crazy doesn't go away with love, understanding and talk-therapy. These maggots are just what I called them earlier -- irredeemable. They are worthless canker sores on the ass of humanity. This kind of crazy is a clear sign of an ultra-violent offender who would just as easily hurt or kill another human, if they can find a way to get away with it, as they would something as innocent as a trusting dog.

Their removal from the planet is a contribution to the safety of your fellow **(civilized)** citizens.
