# Storm Tracking and
Brain Farts

It's been an interesting week if you like storm tracking.  I follow huricanes and snow
storms and try to beat the professional meteorologists for timing and accuracy
of a storm's path.  I do pretty well.  I did really well with _**Matthew **_last year.  The TV guys were throwing darts all over the southeast coast right up until the last possible
minute.  I had it pegged to weaken and hit South Carolina two days prior to landfall.

I started tracking Irma early on.  The weather guys started talking about Irma
going up the east coast days ago.  But I could not see their logic.  Using the
same information they use, without the luxury of their computer modeling, I
failed to see the prevailing conditions developing to steer the storm north
until today.  Even now, I don't see an abrupt turn north.

In fact, from looking at isobars, the movement of a cold front sliding in and prevailing winds, upper and lower, I think the storm may slow its rate of advance and wobble a bit. 
It might even do a very short jog south further over western Cuba before moving north.  And I only give it evenodds that it doesn't go into the gulf versus up and hard into Florida.

But its all a crap shoot for me.  And it's not too much better for the pros.

I depend on all those prevailing conditions listed above.  The hard part being that you
don't know how accurately **they** are being predicted.  When I first started
tracking Irma, the front it is approaching was not a predicted factor.  But you can now see it interacting with the storm in satellite imagery.

If Irma goes hard against that front, she will slide north as if the front and Irma had interlocking gears.

I am also hearing talk of wind shear.  If it is strong, it will blow Irma out
quickly.  But again, I didn't see that on my Intellicast maps until today and I'm not sure how strong the effect will be.

Still, I am prepared. We keep a storm shelter in the middle of the house.  This week we topped off the water supply and I still have to go out and get extra gas for the generator.

## Oh, that damn generator!

I went out to test run the generator today.  I set the choke and slid the throttle full
and pulled the starter.  Nothing.  Maybe I had the choke position backward.  Pull. 
Nothing.  Center choke to run.  Nothing.  Start cursing.  That didn't help either.

"Oh google!"

I read the user manual. Set throttle.  Set choke.  I had it right the first time.  Pull nothing. Go to next page.  And there itwas!  I had forgotten this generator was equipped with a high-tech ONO-ff positioner device.  "Make sure on/off switch is in on
position".  Duh.

Okay generator's working. I put it under a load for a bit, running some shop tools and that chore was done.

When you do your preps for future events (too late for Fl and TX) be sure to get gallons of water along with bottles.  AND don't get confused and get distilled water.  That can injure or kill you.  **You don't drink distilled water!**

Get marine-grade (boat) fuel.  This will be for power equipment like chain
saws lawn tractors and generators. Regular gas has ethanol in it. 
Ethanol is a worthless additive we are forced by corrupt laws to put on
our cars.  It is not good for our cars, but it can trash small engines.  And you
don't want that to happen in a pinch.

You should remember (as I never do) to run your generatorevery couple of months and put it under an electrical load.  From what industrial generator experts tell me, that is not only an important test, it is good for the generator.  Don't ask me why.

Big D-cell flashlights are good.  Bigger dry cell lamps are better. Lots of small led devices are very handy.

Canned meats and canned meals that are actually precooked are great to have.  You can heat them up in the can.  And if you are really stuck for a heat source, they can be eaten cold. If you have military style MRE's you in like Flynn.  Rations have come a long way since I was a Beach Master in the early 80's.  I wasn't a fan of half of what you'd find in a case of C-rats.

Decide ahead of time if you are going to evacuate or ride out a storm.  If you decide to bug out, go early.  Go as soon as evacuation talk starts.  If you wait for the order you'll be where people in the southeast are today. You'll be sitting on a highway for possibly days.

There is much more to all this.  I will cover it over in the next few
installments along with how to create your own storm shelter and bug-out bags.

If you are in south Florida right now, go to shelter or as high as you can in a concrete building. If you are on the ground, at sea level you will likely have a very bad
time of it.

Let's hope I, **and the real meteorologists, **are totally wrong on this one.  Let's hope the wind sheer is kick-ass!  Let's hope that front catches a strong bite of Irma and sends her back out into the Atlantic.  If it does, the worst-case scenario is that alot of people had a really shitty road trip and life can go on.
