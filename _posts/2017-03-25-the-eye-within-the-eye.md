# The Eye Within the Eye

## A good photo

There is something about a quality photograph that really speaks to us.

I know a few good photographers. And I know that if we stood shoulder-to-shoulder with identical cameras and snapped pictures of the same kid we get different results. People would look at my photos and say, "Look. cute kid."

But from a photographer with a gift, they'd say something like, "I just can't stop looking at this kid. Look her eyes! You can just sense..." Or, "The eyes practically reach out of the picture..."

I've heard people say that the secret to good photography is lighting or composition or some other technical aspect. I can tell you first hand that's not so. I've taken thousands of pictures in my lifetime and few actually exude life.

No doubt, those things are important. But there is far more to it.

People like [Kathleen Roche][0] have that innate ability to give a photograph life. I envy them.

I use her work here and hope to do so more on the future.

But among the hobbies, habits and passions one may pursue, one that can bring real satisfaction as well as tangible results would have to be photography.

Tom Jordan, a photographer from Pennsylvania, says the he goes out and just walks. It could be on the beach, or in Philadelphia or in his favorite park (location secret) and he says, "I don't know what I'm going to get, or where I'm going to get it, but I know that day I'm going to really nail a picture."
