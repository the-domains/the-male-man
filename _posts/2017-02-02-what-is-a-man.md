# What is a Man?

There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn't **quite** uniquely American, but it's close.

In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT...There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.

Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case, the typical American male is not a creature to be sneered at, but respected.

The man we celebrate here teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they'll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.

He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he's developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.

The REAL American man says "thank you" to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.

He isn't arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.

If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.

This is the man our site is dedicated to.
