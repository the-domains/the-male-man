# What is a Man?

There is an image of what Americans see as manhood that isn't **quite** uniquely American, but it's close.

In a world where we are constantly being pitted, one group of people against another, we are sometimes expected to apologize for who we are. This website will never subscribe to the homogenized view of what people are supposed to be. BUT...There are qualities that identify us and they shouldn't be scoffed at.

Here, we celebrate what people are. And in this case we celebrate the strong, American male role model.

The man we celebrate teaches his kids early the value of a dollar, respect for property, reading for enjoyment and love of competition. He exposes them to his passions and interest. Of course, he hopes they'll adopt them. But what is important is that they develop their own.

He exudes strength in whatever capacity he possesses it; through whatever talents and abilities he's developed. He takes quiet pleasure in a job well-done.

The REAL American man says "thank you" to kindnesses. He greets people confidently and happily. He leaves a room, a crowd, a campsite and his planet better off than the way he found it; even if only in small measure.

He isn't arrogant. He loves easily. He beams with pride at his kids. His son makes him want to measure up. His daughter OWNS him.

If he is smart, a part of what motivates him to fix a light switch, replace a pipe, paint a wall, or head out to work everyday, is his desire to show off for the woman he loves.

This is the man our site is dedicated to.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pictures in this article gave me a thought. This website will use advertising to keep the lights on. And we will make the ads content appropriate. We won't put an ad for an iPad in a post about chain saws.

Anyway, the thought. Tools kits for kids. One of the most important things I think I missed as a kid was familiarity with proper tools and their uses, and mechanical experience. I learned much of it in the Navy and I am a self-taught furniture maker. But I'd have been much further ahead of the game as a young man if someone had mentored me in _any_ of the trades.

So here are some suggestion for bringing kids into the trades in a fun way. By "playing" with your son or daughter, going through the motions of using play tools, you not only engage them in a learning activity, you create a bond around that activity.

## For the Toddler:

I chose this kit because it had a good variety of tools and some hardware. It makes the use of the tools less abstract over time. It will be easier to keep a kid angaged by "fixing" lots of things in different ways.

HOWEVER!!!

If you are Harley guy, and there are lots of you out there, there's always this kit:

There's not as many pieces, but damn! It's a Harley kit!

Either way, by using toys like this, as well as doctor kits and crayons, you can immerse yourself in you own kid's world. Let him imitate and then lead, go back and forth. If you are a first time father you will be amazed at what you learn about your son or daughter as you do this. And they will love you for it.
