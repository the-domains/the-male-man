# Following the Tour de France

## The Best Tour in YEARS!

I have become a big fan of the Tour de France. I love cycling and have always admired the super-human performances you see in these events. That the Tour occurs in the dead of summer makes the more grueling stages that much more impressive. (Full disclosure - even when I do participate in bicycle events, I always look for the ones that occur on the coast. No hills.)

Working from home, on my own schedule has allowed me to follow the tour much more intently. After three years of catching just about every stage, I confess I still don't quite understand the scoring. Nor do I understand this weird gentlemen's agreement that you don't break away when your arch rival is working through a mechanical problem.

Today, Stage 9, several riders started to attack after Chris Froome (yelow jersey leader) suffered an apparent gearing problem. After running a few hundred yards, Dan Martin signaled to the others that this wasn't kosher. They actually slowed down to allow Froome and what was left of Team Sky CATCH UP! Martin would soon pay dearly for this decision.

I am not altogether sure Froome would have done the same thing. He may not have bolted, but I think he'd have at least continued his pace, having the discipline to break when it was strategically smart to do so. But he damn sure wouldn't have slowed his pace to WAIT for someone to get a new bike!

## Wicked Wreck

This year's tour has featured some horrendous climbs. The Stage 9 final climb has been considered one of the key challenges of the entire tour. The riders climbed for miles over several hours. There were a few drops that would pass quickly, then it was back to climbing. The final climb was brutal. It is no wonder they haven't used this particular stretch of road since the '70s. 

As the riders went over the top, they had an almost 7-mile downhill run. Watching them maneuver through the turns made my knees weak. I mentioned to my wife that coming out of such a long, hard climb these guys heads could be a little muddled. The heat only accentuated the possibility.

Well, about halfway through a 45-50 mile-per hour run, Richie Porte caught his back wheel on the skirt of the road inside a tight left curve. The bike went out from under him and he skidded straight across the road into a field of five other riders. Martin had zero time to react. Porte carried Martin and his bike straight into a rock face on the racers' right. 

[If you look at the still shot in this link, it is almost impossible to tell where Porte begins and Martin ends, much less where the bike is.][0]

Amazingly, Martin got up, grabbed a new bike from his chase car and finished just 1:15 behind the stage winner, Rigoberto Uran.

More amazing, Porte didn't suffer a broken neck! He was driven into the embankment at 45 MPH, folded in half and flipped back onto the road. Watching the crash, I was certain he was critically injured.

The latest I have, as of this afternoon, he has a concussion and some bad cuts and bruises. 

CUTS AND BRUISES?! One of the commentators said it best. Imagine you are in a car moving at 45 miles and hour. You are basically wearing your underwear and a styrofoam cup on your head. Now jump out of the car into the guard rail.

These guys are either supermen or VERY lucky.

Two other riders also crashed out of the Tour today. Froome (remember how Martin and others stayed with him) increased his overall lead from 12 to 18 seconds. He still has the yellow jersey.

With Thomas and Porte out of the race Froome's odds of finishing the Tour with the yellow are improved.
