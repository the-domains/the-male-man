# Cigars: A Brief History (Part 1)

The year was 1992\. The American cigar industry was in poor shape. The customer base was aging and contracting, sales had been in a steady 30-year decline and the men who made cigars and grew tobacco no longer encouraged their children to follow in their footsteps.

"I did not think that there was a future in the cigar industry," said Carlos Toraño in 2006, speaking about the state of the cigar industry in the 1980s. His father, grandfather, cousins, uncles---just about everyone with the surname Toraño had worked with cigar tobacco, dating back to Cuba in 1916\. But he was happy when his son Charlie chose a new career path, opting to become a lawyer instead of a tobacco man in August 1992\.

American cigar consumption was spiraling to all-time lows, having dropped by more than 66 percent between the mid-1960s and early 1990s, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Imports of premium, handmade cigars, which had hovered around the 100 million-unit mark throughout the 1980s, decreased by 2.6 percent between 1990 and 1991, to 103.6 million cigars.

"One of \[my relatives\] compared the cigar business to the buggy whip business," wrote Stanford Newman about the U.S. cigar industry at that time in his autobiography _Cigar Family_. "A dying industry with no future."

But Newman, and everyone else in the cigar industry, had no idea that the cigar boom was about to begin, and this centuries-old industry that has weathered all manner of challenges was about to be changed like never before.

We've all heard the tale of Columbus witnessing Cuba's indigenous population twisting up tobacco leaves and enjoying a rustic smoke, and how the explorer brought the raw material back to Europe. Webster's dates the origin of the word "cigar" back to 1730, from the Spanish _cigarro_, and what we think of as a cigar today---made of filler, binder and wrapper---appeared in the early eighteenth century, according to Tobacco in History and Culture. Spain developed quite the appetite for cigars, one that exceeded its ability to produce them, leading to Spanish investment in its then-colony of Cuba, where cigar production began in earnest.

The population of Havana boomed after the king of Spain declared free trade in 1818 in the country, which remained a Spanish colony until 1898\. It was during that period that many of Cuba's famous cigar brands were created. Punch was formed in 1840 by a German, the famous Partagás factory was built in 1845 by Spaniard Jaime Partagás, El Rey del Mundo and Sancho Panza were created by the German Emilio Ohmstedt in 1848 and Hoyo de Monterrey was founded in 1865 by José Gener, a young immigrant from Spain.

One hundred years ago, cigar smoking was quite common, and cigar factories seemed to be everywhere. "The cigar profession commanded a fair amount of prestige at the turn of the century. Cigars were arguably the most popular tobacco product in America," wrote Stanford Newman. "Almost every city in the East and Midwest had at least one small cigar factory." These factories were not necessarily large operations, and many were simply a person in a room rolling cigars.

Newman's father, J. C., began rolling cigars in the barn behind his family's Cleveland home in 1895, creating J. C. Newman Cigar Co., which still exists to this day. At the time, that facility was one of 300 cigar factories in Cleveland, and one of 42,000 in the entire United States.

Wherever they were rolled, all cigars were made entirely by hand until around 1920, when the first cigar making machines appeared, and they became more common after the Great Depression. In the meantime, cigarettes came on the scene, as they were included in the mess kits of G.I.s during the First World War, and began edging aside cigars in popularity. By the mid-1920s they had become the nation's most popular form of tobacco.

Cigar sales were largely flat in the 1940s and early 1950s, and most of the cigars made in America (outside of Florida) were being made by machine. On the premium end of the cigar business, Americans had a great appreciation for Cuban tobacco, almost all of it rolled in Tampa, Florida, into cigars that were known as Clear Havanas. And they were inexpensive. Arturo Fuente sold a diminutive size known as a Breva for 10 cents apiece at the time. "Pre-embargo, most cigars in the United States that were considered premium were a quarter," said longtime cigar industry veteran Sherwin Seltzer in a 1998 _Cigar Insider_ interview. Imported Havanas, a small part of the business, cigars reserved for the extremely well-off, could be had for those willing to spend about 65 cents.

Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba in the late 1950s would forever change the world of cigars. In 1960, Castro seized control of Cuba's cigar and tobacco industry, and his regime plucked the country's cigar gems: it nationalized the Hoyo de Monterrey factory, home of Punch, Belinda and the Hoyo brand; seized the H. Upmann factory from owners Menendez and Garcia, taking with it Cuba's famous Montecristo and H. Upmann brands; and grabbed the emblematic Partagás Factory from owner Ramón Cifuentes. "They came inside, and said, 'We're here to intervene the company,' " Cifuentes told _Cigar Aficionado_ in an interview. "And they didn't allow me to take anything."

The nationalization of Cuba's cigar industry led to the exile of many of its famed tobacco and cigar men, which led to the rise of the non-Cuban cigar industry. When U.S. President John F. Kennedy signed an embargo prohibiting nearly all trade between Cuba and the United States in 1962, it forced cigar makers to reinvent their blends. Cuban leaf, the lifeblood of the cigar industry, was now off-limits to American smokers.
